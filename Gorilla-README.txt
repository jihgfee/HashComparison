** Assignment info:
   Mark one of the following boxes with an X

   [ X ] Yes, to the best of our knowledge, everything works as it
   should. In particular, here is the test client for vector
   operations (length, angle) that our code has passed:

	//Test Methods
	private boolean testGeometry()
	{
		if(getCompareValue(new int[]{2,0}, new int[]{0,3}) != 0)
			return false;
		
		if(getCompareValue(new int[]{2,2}, new int[]{2,-2}) != 0)
			return false;
		
		if(getCompareValue(new int[]{1,0}, new int[]{6,0}) != 1)
			return false;
		
		if(lengthMethod(new int[]{0,1}) != 1)
			return false;
		
		if(lengthMethod(new int[]{3,4}) != 5)
			return false;
		
		return true;
	}
	
	Note, that the getCompareValue is the method we use to compute cos(angle)

	
   [ ] No, our solution does not work. (We will not get credit for this.)
   In particular, 

   ... (explain what doesn't work)

   The assignment description was very very hard to translate, and it took me quite a while to even understand what i was supposed to do
   Otherwise, fun assignment
